## Campus clusters

> Currently, UC, Merced has two clusters on site. They are maintained by the [CIRT](https://it.ucmerced.edu/Research-Computing-People) team. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4).

      MERCED (Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and Discovery) Cluster is a 1,872 core Linux based high performance computing cluster. MERCED cluster running on <Tag color="#3399ff">Recharge</Tag> model which means users need to pay per core-hour usage. More details on the recharge information can be found below.

    MERCED recharge calculations
    ```
    Total Cost ($) = # of cores x Duration (wall clock hours) x (cost per core-hour)
    ```
    - A core-hour is a single compute core used for one hour (a core-hour) and 2G of RAM. 
    - Cost per core-hour is $0.01

    :::
    __why should I be willing to invest in this?__
      - ðŸ”´ The MERCED cluster offers unlimited wall clock time, allowing users to run significantly longer jobs without time constraints. 
      - ðŸŸ¢ The MERCED queue is less crowded, allowing jobs to be picked up with shorter waiting times.
      - ðŸŸ¡ All recharge funds will go toward cluster maintenance, including network switch replacements and hardware upkeep. The CIRT team will not profit from these contributions.
