The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) hosts two summer programs:

The CyberInfrastructure-Enabled Machine Learning (CIML) Summer Institute is a three-day institute that teaches machine learning (ML) concepts to researchers, students, developers, and educators. It explains how to move ML applications from smaller machines, like laptops and workstations, to extensive high-performance computing (HPC) systems, such as SDSC's Expanse supercomputer. Participants will learn through interactive classes and hands-on tutorials using Expanse with provided training accounts.

The HPC and Data Science Summer Institute is a comprehensive week-long workshop that covers introductory-to-intermediate topics in HPC, data science, and artificial intelligence (AI). It aims to give attendees a thorough overview of these topics to accelerate their learning process through highly interactive classes and hands-on tutorials on the Expanse supercomputer.

 
With funding support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), both programs will be extending a limited number of room & board and/or travel support.

Room & Board: on-campus private dorm-style rooms with shared common spaces and bathrooms and meals at a campus dining facility
Travel: meant to cover the cost of airfare and other identified travel expenses
