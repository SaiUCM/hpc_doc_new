Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) is soliciting proposals for computer time on a third-generation Anton system--Anton 3--an extremely fast special-purpose supercomputer for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation designed and constructed by D. E. Shaw Research (DESRES) and hosted at PSC. This third-generation Anton system is 10x faster and supports 10x larger simulations than Anton 2, and is ~100 times faster for MD than the latest general-purpose supercomputers or GPU systems. Anton is made available without cost by DESRES with operational support from NIH for non-commercial research by universities and other not-for-profit institutions. Proposals are due on Monday, October 21, 2025.


If you are running any MD simulation calculations, I encourage you to take advantage of the more powerful national supercomputers.
