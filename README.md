# Welcome!
This is the landing for the UC Merced HPC and JupyterHub Documentation GitHub.

## How to Install and Contribute
We are always looking for contributors to add content(e.g tutorials, examples, documentation, etc.) to the site. Please visit the [contrib.md](/contrib.md) to learn how to contribute to the documentation site. 

## Overall Goal of the Documentation. 
This documentation is home to both High Performance Computing (HPC) and JupyterHub Documentation at the University of California, Merced. While these topics are two distinct topics, we hope our documentation will share many common goals and have overlap in common topics and audiences. 

## Contact 
If you are a user with technical issues on either the campus clusters or Jupyterhub or need more indivualized support please open a Servicehub ticket for [hpc](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4), or [Jupyterhub](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=9d79262483011a1066ac93647daad3e6&form_id=69d58f061b6bc6905f3aed74bd4bcb2a).

### Note:
If contributing to the docs or have a question about the documentation site (and it's content), feel free to open a pull request and one of the maintainers will communicate with you.
